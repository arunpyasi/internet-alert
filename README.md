# internet-alert
Siren when internet is ON after an outage or vice versa.
I wrote this when my internet fibre was broken and my ISP took 35 hours to fix it. I was looking at the router's LED in a cronjob of 20 seconds interval that is why I thought to write it. So, thought why not put it in Github too :P
